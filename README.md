# Collision-Required-Godot

My Commision for the Godot Wild Jam 53

and my Attempt at learning Godot

Not a 100% happy with this one. Cause of the time frame and the new engine i worked in, some code is a bit sloppy. But overall I feel like i learned a ton during this jam.

The theme for the game jam was Assembly required, 

In the game your playing as two sentient rocks that has to collide with eachother to be able to kill the enemy dwarfs that is trying to mine you.
